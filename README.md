# php_portal
## Welcome to the simplest and least secure way to create and manage a web portal
As you will read in the wiki, this project merely serves demonstration purposes and focuses on spedific aspects, and due to time consrtiction other aspects like security have been neglected.

The coding follows the procedural style of PHP coding, and might often resemble C/C++/GoLang structure as I am more familiar with these languages.

Most of the HTML code has been copied from third arty sources as it is not the main focus. 

## Goal
This project aims to create a webportal for employees and administrators to log in, and manage leave requests. The employees can log in the site and make requests, while the administrator(s) can log in to create new users. Requests made by employees reach the administrator(s) through email, where they can approve or reject it, which then notifies employee with another email.
